## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

In an R Markdown file, you can write both plain text (without comment symbols!) and code in the same file. R Markdown files can also be `knitted` to output to different formats (including pdf, html, Word document).

To execute code, write it in a grey formatted code block (blank ones will be included for all exercises). Then place a cursor on the line or highlight the lines you want to run and hit enter, just like you would in an .R code file. 

```{r demo}
mean(c(3,4,5,6)) # command to get the mean of a list of numbers
getwd() # command to print your working directory
```
